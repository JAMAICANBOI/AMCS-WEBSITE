In higher education, we often encounter students who are experiencing unexpected setbacks that impact their ability to attend class. Whether it's due to a car accident, a family emergency, or an illness, the inability to get to class can have a lasting effect on a student's academic success. Often, students experience excessive stress trying to catch up on missed coursework. In some cases, they have no choice other than to withdraw from their classes, putting them a semester or more behind and delaying degree completion â€” if they return at all.

The right solution to help students with short-term needs is not always readily available. Institutions can grant them special accommodations and flexibility, extending assignment deadlines or offering alternate exam dates, but such solutions often fail to provide comparable learning experiences. Absent students miss in-class opportunities for interaction and collaboration, which limits their full learning potential. Further, instructors often experience added workload stress from managing student accommodations, which range from creating alternate assignments to scheduling locations and times for make-up exams to grading work at the last minute. Ultimately, these circumstances can result in a less-than-optimal course experience for everyone involved.
