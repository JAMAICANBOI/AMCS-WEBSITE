					Imagine, you are trying to make an investment somewhere in the World and you want to be face to face with your investment advisor without leaving your own office or room?


Well, your options can be differentâ€”right from using Skype or making phone calls to something that is called telepresence.

Telepresence is one of the fascinating new phenomena which is gradually taking over the realm of meetings and performing a lot of tasks without being actually present in the place. It is like helping individuals to experience and do whatever they want to do without being present at some remote place. What is different about telepresence is that you can be telepresent through someone else instead of being even present through video conferencing or other methods.

Telepresence can occur at two levels i.e. one where people meet virtually without leaving their offices or homes. In the second case, telepresence can also take place where someone else acts and behaves as per the orders and demands of another person. The second option provides an exciting alternative to the use of technology and the human interaction where one person can experience anything through the eyes of another person.

I the financial sector, companies are using telepresence to connect their customers with their loan officers, investment advisors, and other employees to discuss all the requirements and provide solutions without actually the presence of the customer as well as the financial organization at the same place.

This new trend is revolutionary in the sense that it can provide banks and other financial institutions necessary and important tools to actually connect with their customers at more individual and personal level rather than using their traditional call center facilities.

Cryptocurrency investment is another area where telepresence can be of great importance given the fact that it can create human involvement on a remote level to manage and oversee the large transactions. One of the areas of concerns regarding cryptocurrencies is the fact that it is completely managed and controlled through the computer systems without any mediating or intervening process.

Once a transaction is performed, it cannot be reversed despite the fact that it may be fake or fraudulent in nature. Telepresence can actually add the necessary element of required confirmation on the remote level to execute large transactions without requiring physical presence or confirmations.
