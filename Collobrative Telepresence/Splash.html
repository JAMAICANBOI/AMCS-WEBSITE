		<p>Have you ever watched the film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSp1dM2Vj48"><em>Ready Player One ?</em></a> it's similar to collaborative telepresence, now imagine a group of people in different parts of the world smoothly interacting as if they were physically together, down to being able to feel one another’s touch. The components that will enable such “collaborative telepresence” could transform how we work and play together, rendering physical location irrelevant. Just like the communication tools of today have done that before. 	<br><br>
			This website is aimed at <strong >FOUR</strong> areas of <strong>COLLOBRATIVE TELEPRESENCE.</strong>These are:
			<ul>
				<li>Education</li>
